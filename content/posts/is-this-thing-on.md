# Hello?
## Can you hear me?
### Hi!
I'm Gurshaan (just Shaan, if you're chill like that), I'm 17,
Punjabi, and I go by any pronouns. I hope with this blog I'll have

people that have been begging me to shut up.

I like a lot of stuff. Here's some, alphabetically,
* Anti-Racism
* Catppuccin (the theme this very site is using!)
* Comic Book Movies
* Comics
* Computers
* Feminism
* Free Software
* Kanye West (unfortunately)
* Linux
* Literature
* Math
* Movies
* Music
* Open Source
* Physics
* Poetry
* Programming
* Silence
* Socialism
* Superheroes
* The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind
* TV
